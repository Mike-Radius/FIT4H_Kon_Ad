locate crontab = An easy way to search for a file with crontab in its file name

locate -b "\crontab" = searches only for "crontab"

As a result, any files that you created today will not normally be searchable with the locate command. If you have access to the system as the root user (the system administrator account), you can manually update this file by running the "updatedb" command.

Another possible solution to searching for "newer" files is to make use of the find command. This command searches the live filesystem, rather than a static database.

whereis passwd = The "whereis" command only searches for commands and man pages, not just any file.
